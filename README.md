# Xenalytics Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains my award-winning submission for the Xenalytics Data Science competition, where I secured the first prize by accurately predicting stock prices for five different companies. The predictions are based on a comprehensive analysis using various charts and plots generated with libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. Additionally, I implemented a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for the stock price predictions.
